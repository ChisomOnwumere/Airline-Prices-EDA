Exploratory Data Analysis for Airline Prices dataset 
# Airplane Price Dataset EDA

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a dataset of airplane prices. The dataset includes various features related to different airplane models, including production year, engine type, capacity, range, fuel consumption, and more. The purpose of this project is to analyze the dataset to uncover insights about airplane pricing and the factors that influence it.

## Dataset
The dataset is in CSV format and includes the following columns:
- **Model**: The model name of the airplane.
- **Üretim Yılı**: Year of production.
- **Motor Sayısı**: Number of engines.
- **Motor Türü**: Type of engine (e.g., Turbofan, Piston).
- **Kapasite**: Seating capacity.
- **Menzil (km)**: Range in kilometers.
- **Yakıt Tüketimi (L/saat)**: Fuel consumption in liters per hour.
- **Saatlik Bakım Maliyeti ($)**: Hourly maintenance cost in USD.
- **Yaş**: Age of the airplane in years.
- **Satış Bölgesi**: Sales region.
- **Fiyat ($)**: Price in USD.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are included:

Distribution of airplane prices.
Boxplot of prices by sales region.
Scatter plot of production year vs price.
Correlation heatmap of various features.
Conclusions
The EDA results provide insights into the factors affecting airplane prices, highlighting differences by sales region and production year.
